# Channel Fun 'Hockey', 3DS Edition
A Nintendo 3DS Homebrew port of the Fairchild Channel F video game "Hockey".

"Hockey" is a clone of the classic game "Pong" which uses the typical main paddle and introduces a second paddle that acts like a goalie. The main paddle has some unique mechanics in "Hockey" which include 2D movement (rather than just one-axis movement) and center-pivot rotation.

Channel Fun 'Hockey' (3DS Edition) is a port of the original game from the Fairchild Channel F to the Nintendo 3DS, modified so that local online multiplayer is possible. There is no game engine involved, and only C programming is used (for the most part).

# Why Though?
Why not?

But seriously, the purpose of this project was so that I can introduce myself to the general idea of game development without a game engine.

# Is it available yet?
At the moment, it is still a work-in-progress.

# How can I play?
To play Channel Fun 'Hockey', you will need a original 3DS (or newer) with CFW (Custom Firmware). From there, download the .3dsx file above and send it to the appropriate folder in your SD card. After that, it should be available to for you to play. Enjoy!
