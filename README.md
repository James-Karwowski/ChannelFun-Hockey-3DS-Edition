# Channel F 'Hockey' (3DS Edition)
A Nintendo 3DS Homebrew version of the Fairchild Channel F video game "Hockey".

"Hockey" is a clone of the classic game "Pong" which uses the typical main paddle and introduces a second paddle that acts like a goalie. The main paddle has some unique mechanics in "Hockey" which include 2D movement (rather than just one-axis movement) and center-pivot rotation.

Channel Fun 'Hockey' (3DS Edition) is a port of the original game from the Fairchild Channel F to the Nintendo 3DS, modified so that local online multiplayer is possible. There is no game engine involved, and only C programming is used (for the most part). This game is open-source, so if you wanted to modify the game in some way (i.e change the colors of the assets, add a background image, etc.), that is perfectly fine.

Channel Fun 'Hockey' (3DS Edition) is not in a playable state at the moment, however, when it is playable I will add the release version of the game to the top.

# Q&A
# Why Though?
The purpose of this project was so that I can introduce myself to the general idea of game development without using a game engine.

# Is it available yet?
At the moment, the game is still a work-in-progress, and it requires a lot of development before the game is fully complete.

# Who are You?
As of the creation of this repository, I am a first-year CS Major at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte with the status of junior. I am planning on having a concentration in Cyber Security.

# How can I play?
To play Channel Fun 'Hockey', you will need to get an original 3DS (or newer) with CFW (Custom Firmware). From there, download the .3dsx file above and send it to the appropriate /3ds/ folder on your SD card. After that, it should be available to for you to play. Enjoy!
