DISCLAIMER: Channel F 'Hockey' (3DS Edition) is not in a FULLY playable state at the moment, however, when it is finished I will add the release version of the game below.

!!! IMPORTANT !!! - The name below is NOT the final name of this project, and is likely to change over the course of development.
# Pong 2 (3DS Edition) - DEMO
A Nintendo 3DS Homebrew version of the Fairchild Channel F video game "Hockey".

"Hockey" is a clone of the classic game "Pong" which uses the typical main paddle and introduces a second paddle that acts like a goalie. The main paddle has some unique mechanics in "Hockey" which include 2D movement (rather than just one-axis movement) and center-pivot rotation.

This game is a variation of the original game from the Fairchild Channel F for the Nintendo 3DS, modified so that local online multiplayer is possible. There is no game engine involved, and only C programming is used (for the most part).

This game is open-source, so if you wanted to modify the game in some way (i.e change the colors of the assets, add a background image, etc.), that is perfectly fine.
NOTE: You will need devKitPro, any text-editting software, and either a modded 3DS (Not recommended for editting software) OR a 3DS emulator (recommended).

# Q&A
# Why Though?
The purpose of this project was so that I can introduce myself to the general idea of game development without using a game engine.

# Is it available yet?
At the moment, the game is still a work-in-progress, and it requires a lot of development before the game is fully complete.

# Who are You?
As of the creation of this repository, I am a first-year CS Major at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte with the status of junior. I am planning on having a concentration in Cyber Security.

# How can I play?
To play Channel Fun 'Hockey', you will need to get an original 3DS (or newer) with CFW (Custom Firmware) OR a 3DS emulator (not recommended for multiplayer). From there, download the .3dsx file above and send it to the appropriate /3ds/ folder on your SD card. After that, it should be available for you to play. Enjoy!

# Where's Singleplayer mode?
Singleplayer will automatically load up, just press B to unpause the game and start playing!

# Where's Multiplayer mode?
Multiplayer mode is still a WIP.

As of the most recent commit, I plan to include two services for multiplayer. There will be an online multiplayer service and what I call the MIR service. MIR (Multiplayer Infrared) has two modes, Host (MIR-H, pronounced Murray) and Client (MIR-C, pronounced Mercy), and is center around using the IR sensor.
